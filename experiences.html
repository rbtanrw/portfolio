                    <h5>Vice Chairman of HIMTI's 32nd Anniversary</h5>
                    <div class="desc">
                        <p>HIMTI's 32nd Anniversary took the theme of costume party in zombie apocalypse. This theme is a new innovation in HIMTI that aims to create a different ambience in an anniversary celebration. The theme taken is to illustrate the hope that arises in a state of distress, in the hope that we will become stronger after the trouble.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>As a vice chairman, I have responsibilities to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Determine theme, concept, and financial planning of the event with other DPI (Core Management Committee, which include Chairman, Vice Chairman, Secretary, and Treasurer)</li>
                            <li>Schedule big meetings for committees and divisions</li>
                            <li>Monitor each division's progress</li>
                            <li>Specifically guide Funds & Registration Division as an Advisor</li>
                            <li>Assist division that is overloaded with tasks</li>
                            <li>Monitoring and technical assistance on D-day</li>

                    <div class="desc">
                        <p>Seskam is a mandatory event for HIMTI's activist candidates to prepare them to become activists who are ready and able to contribute to the organization. These candidates are divided into several groups, each of which has a mentor.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>My job as a mentor is to guide these activist candidates to work together to make the project given in this event. In addition, it is important for me to do bonding and break the ice because many of the candidates don't know each other yet.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>In this event, I also contributed as a volunteer for the security division. Some of the tasks I did included:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Organize the group line</li>
                            <li>Ensure the order and security of the event</li>
                            <li>Keep the candidates from running away</li>
                            <li>Gather and discipline the candidates</li>
